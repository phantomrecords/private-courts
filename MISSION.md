## Mission Statement

To build a comprehensive digital archive, advocacy platform, and resource hub to expose and counteract gender-biased homeless services that disproportionately harm men. We aim to document stories, collect data, promote reform, and support men who have been unfairly displaced or excluded from services due to systemic discrimination.
